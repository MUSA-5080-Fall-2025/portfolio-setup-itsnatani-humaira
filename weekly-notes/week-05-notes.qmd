## Key Concepts Learned

**Part 1: The Statistical Learning Framework**

Statistical learning -> a set of approaches for estimating that relationship

For any quantitative response Y and predictors X₁, X₂, … Xₚ:

Y=f(X)+ϵ

Where:
f = the systematic information X provides about Y
ε = random error (irreducible)

f represents the true relationship between predictors and outcome
- It’s fixed but unknown
- It’s what we’re trying to estimate
- Different X values produce different Y values through f

Example:
Y = median income
X = population, education, poverty rate
f = the way these factors systematically relate to income

How do we estimate f?

Parametric Methods
- Make an assumption about the functional form (e.g., linear)
- Reduces problem to estimating a few parameters
- Easier to interpret
- Assume f is linear: Y=β₀+β₁X

Non-Parametric Methods
- Don’t assume a specific form
- More flexible
- Require more data
- Harder to interpret
- No assumed form - let data determine shapes

Parametric Approach: Linear Regression
The assumption -> Relationship between X and Y is linear

Y≈β0+β1X1+β2X2+...+βpXp

The task: Estimate the β coefficients using our sample data
The method: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

Advantages:
- Simple and interpretable
- Well-understood properties
- Works remarkably well for many problems
- Foundation for more complex methods

Limitations:
- Assumes linearity
- Sensitive to outliers
- Makes several assumptions

**Part 2: Two Different Goals**

The same model serves different purposes:

Inference
- “Does education affect income?”
- Focus on coefficients
- Statistical significance matters
- Understand mechanisms

Prediction
- “What’s County Y’s income?”
- Focus on accuracy
- Prediction intervals matter
- Don’t need to understand why

Null hypothesis is the claim in scientific research that the effect being studied does not exist.

## Coding Techniques
- Extract features based on spatial relationships:
st_filter(), st_intersects(), st_touches(), st_within()
- r predicate-structure Basic structure: 
t_filter(data_to_filter, reference_geometry, .predicate = relationship)
