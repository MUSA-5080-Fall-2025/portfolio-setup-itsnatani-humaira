## Key Concepts Learned

**Part 1: Why Visualization Matters**
Visual presentation change the impact of your analysis when we have to present it to stakeholders.
- Anscombe’s Quartet and the limits of summary statistics
- Visualization in policy context
- Connection to algorithmic bias and data ethics

Four datasets with identical summary statistics:

- Same means (x̄ = 9, ȳ = 7.5)
- Same variances
- Same correlation (r = 0.816)
- Same regression line

Why this matters for our work:

- Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
- Outliers may represent important communities
- Relationships aren’t always linear
- Visual inspection reveals data quality issues

Example: A county with “average” income might have extreme inequality that algorithms would miss without visualization.

The smaller our sample, the bigger our margin of error.
Datas in Block Group level has higher MOE compared to Census Tract level.

**Part 2 : Grammar of Graphic**
Grammar of Graphics principles:

Data → Aesthetics → Geometries → Visual

Data: Your dataset (census data, survey responses, etc.)
Aesthetics: What variables map to visual properties (x, y, color, size)
Geometries: How to display the data (points, bars, lines)
Additional layers: Scales, themes, facets, annotations

Aesthetics map data to visual properties:

x, y - position
color - point/line color
fill - area fill color
size - point/line size
shape - point shape
alpha - transparency
Important: Aesthetics go inside aes(), constants go outside

**Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis**
Exploratory Data Analysis is detective work:

What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values)
What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends)
What’s unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality issues)
What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation)
How reliable is this data?
Goal: Understand your data before making decisions or building models



## Coding Techniques
- Every ggplot has this pattern:
ggplot(data = your_data) +   aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +   geom_something() +   additional_layers()
