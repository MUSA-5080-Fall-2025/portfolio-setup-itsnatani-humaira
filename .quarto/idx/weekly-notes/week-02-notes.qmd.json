the decennial \"long form\" by gathering detailed, timely socioeconomic, housing, and transportation data for communities to inform planning and funding for services and programs.\n- ACS Data\n*1-Year Estimates (areas > 65,000 people)*\nMost current data, smallest sample \n\n*5-Year Estimates (all areas including census tracts)*\nMost reliable data, largest sample What you’ll use most often\n\nCensus Geographic Hierarchy : Nation>Regions>States>Counties>Census Tracts (1,500-8,000 people)>Block Groups (600-3,000 people)>Blocks (~85 people, Decennial only)\n\nMost policy analysis happens at:\nCounty level - state and regional planning\nCensus tract level - neighborhood analysis\nBlock group level - very local analysis (tempting, but big MOEs)\n\nAccessing Census Data in R\nTraditional approach: Download CSV files from Census website\nModern approach: Use R packages to access data directly --> use the *tidycensus* package\n\nBenefits of programmatic access:\n\nAlways get latest data\nReproducible workflows\nAutomatic geographic boundaries\nBuilt-in error handling \n\nWhen New Data Comes Out\n- ACS 1-year estimates: Released in September (previous year’s data)\n- ACS 5-year estimates: Released in December\n- Decennial Census: Released on rolling schedule over 2-3 years\n\nHelpful Data Sources\n\nTIGER/Line Files\n  - Geographic boundaries (shapefiles)\n  - Census tracts, counties, states\n  - Now released as shapefiles (easier to use!)\n\nHistorical Data Sources:\n  - NHGIS (nhgis.org) - Historical census data\n  - Neighborhood Change Database\n  - Longitudinal Tract Database - Track changes over time\n\nPart 4: Census Data with R\n\ntotal_pop table --> B01003_001\nmedian_income table --> B19013_001\n\n## Coding Techniques\n- [New R functions or
