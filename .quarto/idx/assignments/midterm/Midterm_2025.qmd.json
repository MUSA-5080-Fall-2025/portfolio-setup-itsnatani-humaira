Slides are your main deliverable (present findings). Appendix proves you did the work correctly.\n\n**Q: Can code appear in my presentation slides?** \n\nA: NO! Slides are for city officials. All code goes in the technical appendix.\n\n**Q: How many slides should I have?**  \n\nA: 10-15 maximum. Quality over quantity. Each slide should have a clear purpose.\n\n**Q: Can I use a different city?**  \nA: No, everyone uses Philadelphia for comparability.\n\n**Q: How do I make my .qmd render as revealjs slides?**  \nA: Use `format: revealjs` in your YAML (see template above). Test it early!\n\n**Q: My presentation is 8 minutes. Is that okay?**  \nA: NO! You must cut it to 5 minutes. Practice and trim ruthlessly.\n\n**Q: Should I include all 5 EDA visualizations in my slides?**  \nA: No! Slides should have your best 2-3 visualizations. Put all 5 in the appendix.\n\n**Q: My RMSE is 0.35 in log scale. Is that good?**  \nA: Depends on your data, but 0.25-0.45 is typical for hedonic models. Compare to your baseline or put your data back into dollars!\n\n**Q: Should I remove all outliers?**  \nA: No! Only remove obvious errors. Use log transformation to handle legitimate outliers.\n\n**Q: What if my code works on my computer but not when I knit?**  \nA: Start fresh, restart R, knit in a clean session. Check for hard-coded paths.\n\n**Q: Can I use ChatGPT/Claude to write my analysis?**  \nA: You may use AI for debugging code, but NOT for writing your analysis. \n\n**Q: How formal should my presentation be?**  \nA: Professional but not stuffy. Like you're briefing a city council member who's smart but doesn't know statistics.\n\n**Q: What happens if I go over 5 minutes?**  \nA: I'll politely cut you off and you'll lose points. Practice with a timer!\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Download data\n- Initial cleaning\n- Basic EDA\n\n**Week 2:**\n- Feature engineering\n- Build 4 models\n- Run cross-validation\n- Diagnostics\n- Write conclusions\n- Proofread and submit\n\n---\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\n- You may discuss concepts with classmates\n- You may NOT share code or slides\n- All work must be your own (or your teams)\n- Cite any external resources used\n- Please acknowledge how you used AI in your work and which AI you used (For example, Claude helped me today in coming up with a draft of this assignment, but I edited it thoroughly!)\n\n---\n\n## Final Checklist Before Submitting\n\n### Presentation Slides\n- [ ] Renders correctly as revealjs slides\n- [ ] 10-15 slides maximum\n- [ ] No code visible anywhere\n- [ ] 2-3 polished visualizations\n- [ ] Clear model comparison table\n- [ ] No typos or formatting errors\n- [ ] Professional theme applied\n- [ ] Tested presentation timing (<5 minutes)\n\n### Technical Appendix\n- [ ] Renders correctly as HTML document\n- [ ] All code visible and commented\n- [ ] Data cleaning fully documented\n- [ ] 5+ EDA visualizations included\n- [ ] All features properly created\n- [ ] 4 models with full output\n- [ ] 10-fold CV code runs without errors\n- [ ] Diagnostic plots included\n- [ ] Sparse categories handled correctly\n- [ ] Tested that it knits without errors\n\n### Both Files\n- [ ] Proper file naming convention\n- [ ] Both .qmd source files included\n- [ ] Data sources clearly documented\n- [ ] No hard-coded file paths (use relative paths! - this should be reproducible)\n- [ ] Uploaded to Canvas on time\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Overview\n\n**Due Date:** October 27, 2025\n\n**In-Class Presentations:** October 27, 2025 (5 minutes per team)\n\n**Weight:** 15% of final grade\n\n**Team:** You'll work with your table-mates as a team.

Imagine presenting to the Deputy Mayor.\n\n---\n\n### In-Class Presentation\n\n| Component | Points | Criteria |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| **Content** | 2 | Covers key points efficiently, answers questions thoughtfully |\n| **Time Management** | 2 | Finishes within 5 minutes without rushing |\n\n---\n\n### Technical Appendix \n\n| Component | Points | Criteria |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| **Data Cleaning** | 3 | Complete code, proper filtering, missing value handling, documentation |\n| **EDA** | 3 | 5+ visualizations, each with interpretation |\n| **Feature Engineering** | 3 | Buffers , kNN , census , interactions , all properly created |\n| **Model Building** | 3 | 4 progressive models, proper specification, handles sparse categories |\n| **Cross-Validation** | 3 | Proper 10-fold CV, results table, code runs without errors |\n| **Diagnostics** | 3 | Residual plots included, interpreted, violations addressed |\n| **Code Quality** | 3 | Clean, commented, reproducible, follows best practices, no errors |\n\n**Key:** This is where technical reviewers verify your work. All code must run without errors & be reproducible!!.\n\n---\n\n\n## Example Presentation Structure\n\n**Slide 1: Title**\n- Your team name and teammates\n- Project title\n- Date\n\n**Slide 2: The Problem**\n\n\n**Slide 3: Data Sources**\n- Property sales (n = X,XXX, 2023-2024)\n- Census ACS (income, education, poverty)\n- OpenDataPhilly (parks, transit, crime)\n\n**Slide 4: Where Are Expensive Homes?**\n- [Map visualization]\n- Key pattern observed\n\n**Slide 5: What Drives Prices?**\n- [Best scatter plot or faceted visualization]\n- Key relationship identified\n\n**Slide 6: Model Comparison**\n- [Results table]\n- \"Each layer improves prediction\"\n\n**Slide 7: Top Predictors**\n- Neighborhood (biggest impact)\n- Square footage (β = X)\n- Transit access (β = Y)\n\n**Slide 8: Model Performance**\n- Final RMSE: 0.26 (log scale)\n- Translation: ~26% typical error\n- Beats baseline by 40%\n\n**Slide 9: Hardest to Predict**\n- [Visualization of residuals by neighborhood]\n\n\n**Slide 10: Recommendations**\n\n\n**Slide 11: Limitations & Next Steps**\n\n\n**Slide 12: Questions?**\n- Thank you\n- [Contact info]\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n### Start Early\n- Data cleaning always takes longer than expected\n- OpenDataPhilly can be slow to download\n- Leave time for troubleshooting AND RENDERING!!!\n\n### Check Your Work\n\n- Organize your file directory from the beginning. \n- Run your entire .qmd file from scratch before submitting \n- Make sure all visualizations display\n- Check that your narrative flows logically\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Do I have to create both slides AND an appendix?**  \n\nA: Yes! Slides are your main deliverable (present findings). Appendix proves you did the work correctly.\n\n**Q: Can code appear in my presentation slides?** \n\nA: NO! Slides are for city officials. All code goes in the technical appendix.\n\n**Q: How many slides should I have?**  \n\nA: 10-15 maximum. Quality over quantity. Each slide should have a clear purpose.\n\n**Q: Can I use a different city?**  \nA: No, everyone uses Philadelphia for comparability.\n\n**Q: How do I make my .qmd render as revealjs slides?**  \nA: Use `format: revealjs` in your YAML (see template above). Test it early!\n\n**Q: My presentation is 8 minutes. Is that okay?**  \nA: NO! You must cut it to 5 minutes. Practice and trim ruthlessly.\n\n**Q: Should I include all 5 EDA visualizations in my slides?**  \nA: No! Slides should have your best 2-3 visualizations. Put all 5 in the appendix.\n\n**Q: My RMSE is 0.35 in log scale. Is that good?**  \nA: Depends on your data, but 0.25-0.45 is typical for hedonic models. Compare to your baseline or put your data back into dollars!\n\n**Q: Should I remove all outliers?**  \nA: No! Only remove obvious errors. Use log transformation to handle legitimate outliers.\n\n**Q: What if my code works on my computer but not when I knit?**  \nA: Start fresh, restart R, knit in a clean session. Check for hard-coded paths.\n\n**Q: Can I use ChatGPT/Claude to write my analysis?**  \nA: You may use AI for debugging code, but NOT for writing your analysis. \n\n**Q: How formal should my presentation be?**  \nA: Professional but not stuffy. Like you're briefing a city council member who's smart but doesn't know statistics.\n\n**Q: What happens if I go over 5 minutes?**  \nA: I'll politely cut you off and you'll lose points. Practice with a timer!\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Download data\n- Initial cleaning\n- Basic EDA\n\n**Week 2:**\n- Feature engineering\n- Build 4 models\n- Run cross-validation\n- Diagnostics\n- Write conclusions\n- Proofread and submit\n\n---\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\n- You may discuss concepts with classmates\n- You may NOT share code or slides\n- All work must be your own (or your teams)\n- Cite any external resources used\n- Please acknowledge how you used AI in your work and which AI you used (For example, Claude helped me today in coming up with a draft of this assignment, but I edited it thoroughly!)\n\n---\n\n## Final Checklist Before Submitting\n\n### Presentation Slides\n- [ ] Renders correctly as revealjs slides\n- [ ] 10-15 slides maximum\n- [ ] No
