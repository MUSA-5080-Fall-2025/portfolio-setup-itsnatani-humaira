## Key Concepts Learned

**Part 1: Why Spatial Analysis Matters**

Geographic bias in algorithms:
- Training data may under-represent certain areas
- Spatial autocorrelation violates independence assumptions
- Service delivery algorithms may reinforce geographic inequities

Examples:
- Rideshare algorithms avoiding certain neighborhoods
- Crime prediction concentrating enforcement in specific areas
- Social service algorithms missing rural communities

--> Understand spatial patterns to help design fairer systems

**Part 2: Spatial Data Fundamentals**

Vector Data Model
--> we represent the real world in simplified geometric representation.
There are three basic types:
1. Points → Locations (schools, hospitals, crime incidents)
2. Lines → Linear features (roads, rivers, transit routes)
3. Polygons → Areas (census tracts, neighborhoods, service areas)

Each feature has:
1. Geometry → Shape and location
2. Attributes → Data about that feature (population, income, etc.)

The format of the spatial data is commonly SHAPEFILE.
SHAPEFILE consisted of .shp, .shx, and .dbf.
The other format is geojson, kml/KMZ (Google Earth), and Database connections (PostGIS).

--> The sf Package: Simple Features for R
- Modern replacement for older spatial packages
- Integrates with tidyverse workflows
- Follows international standards
- Fast and reliable

**Part 3: Spatial Operations**


## Coding Techniques
- Extract features based on spatial relationships:
st_filter(), st_intersects(), st_touches(), st_within()
