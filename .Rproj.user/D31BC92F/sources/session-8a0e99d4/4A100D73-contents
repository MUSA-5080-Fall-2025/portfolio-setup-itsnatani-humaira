# Assignment Overview

## Scenario

You are a data analyst for the **Mississippi Department of Human Services**. The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.

Drawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis
- Evaluate data quality using margins of error 
- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making
- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues
- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders

## Submission Instructions

**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`

Make sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an "Assignments" menu.

# Part 1: Portfolio Integration

Create this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:

```
- text: Assignments
  menu:
    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd
      text: "Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration"
```
If there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text

# Setup

```{r setup}
# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
# Set your Census API key
census_api_key("28da3bddd17210421250559be63d8c9379ee190c")
# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state
state_choice <- "MS"
```

**State Selection:** I have chosen **Mississippi** for this analysis because it is among the poorest and most food-insecure states in the U.S. My goal is to identify communities that should be prioritized for social service funding and outreach programs. By directing resources toward the most vulnerable populations, these programs can more effectively address disparities and help uplift communities in greatest need, ultimately working to reduce the overall gap in well-being across the state.

# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment

## 2.1 Data Retrieval

**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.

**Requirements:**
- Geography: county level
- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  
- Year: 2022
- Survey: acs5
- Output format: wide

**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = "code")` syntax.

```{r county-data}
# Write your get_acs() code here
ms_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = c(
    total_pop = "B01003_001",
    median_income = "B19013_001"
  ),
  state = "MS",
  year = 2022,
  survey = "acs5",
  output = "wide"
)
ms_data
# Clean the county names to remove state name and "County" 
# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()
ms_clean <- ms_data %>%
  mutate(
    # Remove state name from county names
    county_name = str_remove(NAME, " County, Mississippi")
  )
# Display the first few rows
head(ms_clean)
```

## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100
- Create reliability categories:
  - High Confidence: MOE < 5%
  - Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%  
  - Low Confidence: MOE > 10%
- Create a flag for unreliable estimates (MOE > 10%)

**Hint:** Use `mutate()` with `case_when()` for the categories.

```{r income-reliability}
# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()
ms_reliability <- ms_clean %>%
  mutate(
    moe_percentage = round((median_incomeM / median_incomeE) * 100, 0),
    reliability = case_when(
      moe_percentage < 5 ~ "High Confidence",
      moe_percentage >= 5 & moe_percentage <= 10 ~ "Moderate Confidence",
      moe_percentage > 10 ~ "Low Confidence",
    ),
    unreliable_estimates = moe_percentage > 10
  )
ms_reliability
# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category
# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages
reliability_summary <- ms_reliability %>%
  group_by(reliability) %>%
  summarize(
    counties = n()) %>%
    mutate(percentage = round((counties / sum(counties)) * 100, 0))
```

## 2.3 High Uncertainty Counties

**Your Task:** Identify the 5 counties with the highest MOE percentages.

**Requirements:**
- Sort by MOE percentage (highest first)
- Select the top 5 counties
- Display: county name, median income, margin of error, MOE percentage, reliability category
- Format as a professional table using `kable()`

**Hint:** Use `arrange()`, `slice()`, and `select()` functions.

```{r high-uncertainty}
# Create table of top 5 counties by MOE percentage
ms_high_uncertainty <- ms_reliability %>%
  arrange(desc(moe_percentage)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5) %>% 
  select(county_name, median_incomeE, median_incomeM, moe_percentage, reliability)
# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption
kable(ms_high_uncertainty,
      col.names = c("County", "Median Income", "Margin of Error", "MOE %", "Reliability"),
      caption = "Counties with Highest Income Data Uncertainty",
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

**Data Quality Commentary:**

Out of Mississippi's 82 counties, 43 have low confidence reliability, with a margin of error (MOE) greater than 10%. This represents 52% of all counties, indicating that a significant portion of the available data may not be reliable for algorithmic decision-making. Relying on such data to inform policies carries a high risk of policy bias, which could result in inaccurate targeting of resources and services.

Some counties with the highest MOE include Carroll, Issaquena, Sharkey, Tunica, and Wilkinson, where income data has MOE values ranging from 23% to 34%. Algorithms dependent on this census income data may therefore misrepresent the actual economic conditions in these areas, potentially leading to communities being underfunded or overlooked.

Several factors may contribute to these high levels of uncertainty, such as:
- Small population sizes, which increase sampling variability.
- Limited survey response rates.
- Data collection challenges, including underreporting or outdated information.
- Economic and demographic fluctuations, which are harder to capture accurately with small sample sizes.

# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis

## 3.1 Focus Area Selection

**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.

**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.

```{r select-counties}
# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data
# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties
selected_counties <- ms_reliability %>% filter(county_name == "Carroll" | county_name == "Chickasaw" | county_name == "DeSoto")
# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics
# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category
select(selected_counties, county_name, median_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability)
```

**Comment on the output:** These three counties represent different levels of data reliability, with a significant gap in their margins of error ranging from 3% to 35%. This poses a challenge for state-level algorithmic decision-making, as counties with lower data reliability may be underrepresented or misrepresented.

## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics

**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.

**Requirements:**
- Geography: tract level
- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)
- Use the same state and year as before
- Output format: wide
- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.

```{r tract-demographics}
# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names

# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data
# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter
ms_counties_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(
    total_pop = "B01003_001",
    white_alone = "B03002_003",
    african_american = "B03002_004",
    hispanic_latino = "B03002_012"
  ),
  state = "MS",
  county = c("015", "017", "033"),
  year = 2022,
  survey = "acs5",
  output = "wide"
)
# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()

# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations
ms_counties_data <- ms_counties_data %>%
  mutate(
    pct_white = round((white_aloneE / total_popE) * 100, 0),          # % White alone
    pct_black = round((african_americanE / total_popE) * 100, 0),     # % African American
    pct_hispanic = round((hispanic_latinoE / total_popE) * 100, 0)    # % Hispanic or Latino
  )
# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar
ms_counties_clean <- ms_counties_data %>%
  mutate(
    # Remove "Census " at the start
    tract_name = str_remove(NAME, "^Census\\s+"),
    
    # Remove "; Mississippi" at the end
    tract_name = str_remove(tract_name, "; Mississippi$")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    county_name = str_extract(NAME, "(?<=; )[^;]+ County")
  )
```

## 3.3 Demographic Analysis

**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.

```{r demographic-analysis}
# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents
# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract
highest_hispanic_tract <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_hispanic)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)
# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()
# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group
county_demographics <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%                  # Group data by county
  summarize(
    num_tracts = n(),                        # Count number of tracts in each county
    avg_pct_white = round(mean(pct_white, na.rm = TRUE), 0),  # Average % White
    avg_pct_black = round(mean(pct_black, na.rm = TRUE), 0),  # Average % Black
    avg_pct_hispanic = round(mean(pct_hispanic, na.rm = TRUE), 0) # Average % Hispanic Latino
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_tracts))                   # Sort counties by number of tracts

# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()
kable(county_demographics,
      col.names = c("County", "Number of Tracts", "White % Average", "Black % Average", "Hispanic / Latino % Average"),
      caption = "County demographics comparison",
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation

## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables

**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable
- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%
- Create summary statistics

```{r demographic-moe}
# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables
# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)
ms_counties_clean <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  mutate(
    moe_pct_white = round((white_aloneM / white_aloneE) * 100, 0),
    moe_pct_black = round((african_americanM / african_americanE) * 100, 0),
    moe_pct_hispanic = round((hispanic_latinoM / hispanic_latinoE) * 100, 0)
  )
# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable
# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement
ms_counties_clean <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  mutate(
    reliability = ifelse(
      moe_pct_white > 15 | moe_pct_black > 15 | moe_pct_hispanic > 15,
      "Low Confidence",
      "High Confidence"
    )
  )
# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues
tract_moe_summary <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  group_by(reliability) %>%                  # Group data by reliability
  summarize(
    num_tracts = n())
```

## 4.2 Pattern Analysis

**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.

```{r pattern-analysis}
# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues
# Calculate average characteristics for each group:
# - population size, demographic percentages

# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison
moe_summary <- ms_counties_clean %>%
  group_by(reliability) %>%
  summarize(
    num_tracts = n(),                                  # Count of tracts in each group
    avg_total_pop = round(mean(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE), 0),    # Average population
    avg_pct_white = round(mean((white_aloneE / total_popE) * 100, na.rm = TRUE), 0),
    avg_pct_black = round(mean((african_americanE / total_popE) * 100, na.rm = TRUE), 0),
    avg_pct_hispanic = round(mean((hispanic_latinoE / total_popE) * 100, na.rm = TRUE), 0)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_tracts))
# Create a professional table showing the patterns
kable(
  moe_summary,
  caption = "Comparison of Census Tracts by MOE Reliability",
  col.names = c("MOE Group", "Number of Tracts", "Avg Population", "Avg % White", "Avg % Black", "Avg % Hispanic"),
  format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
)
```

**Pattern Analysis:** I see no clear pattern of lower data reliability related to the demographic composition of the communities. The data quality appears to be randomly distributed, regardless of which racial or ethnic group dominates a particular census tract.

A possible reason why some tracts have low confidence estimates could be due to small population sizes in those tracts. Smaller populations tend to produce higher margins of error in survey-based estimates, because sampling variability is greater when fewer people are surveyed.


# Part 5: Policy Recommendations

## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary

**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.

**Executive Summary Requirements:**
1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?
2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?
4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?

**Executive Summary:**

Mississippi is one of the hungriest and poorest states in the U.S. To ensure that aid programs are implemented effectively and reach the communities most in need, decisions about which areas receive resources must be based on reliable and accurate data. Unfortunately, our analysis found data quality issues in many parts of Mississippi, creating challenges for equitable program delivery.

Our analysis revealed no clear geographic or demographic pattern to the distribution of low-quality data. Census tracts with high margins of error (MOE) were randomly distributed across the three counties analyzed — Carroll, Chickasaw, and DeSoto — and did not consistently align with the racial or ethnic composition of the population. This suggests that data reliability is not systematically related to whether a tract is majority White, Black, or Hispanic.

Because low data reliability is randomly distributed, all communities are equally at risk of algorithmic bias if unreliable data is used in decision-making.High MOE tracts, regardless of demographic makeup, could be overlooked or misclassified, resulting in unequal access to resources. This risk is particularly concerning in vulnerable areas with high poverty rates, where unreliable data could hide urgent needs and exacerbate existing inequities.

Our findings suggest several underlying factors driving both data quality issues and algorithmic bias risks:
1. Small Population Sizes.	Rural tracts have fewer survey respondents, leading to higher sampling variability and larger margins of error.
2. Survey Coverage Gaps.	Certain areas may have limited census outreach or lower response rates, especially in hard-to-reach communities.

These factors combine to make rural and low-population tracts particularly vulnerable to unreliable data, even though our analysis showed no demographic-specific pattern. To ensure aid programs are accurately targeted and equitable, we recommend the Department take the following actions:

1. Integrate Data Reliability Checks
2. Flag tracts with unreliable data for manual review before decisions are made.
3. Invest in Rural Data Collection
4. Strengthen survey outreach efforts in small or hard-to-reach tracts to increase response rates and improve reliability over time.

The lack of a clear demographic pattern in data reliability suggests that no single community is disproportionately affected by poor data quality. However, the random distribution of unreliable data, especially in rural areas, creates a systemic risk of misallocation and algorithmic bias.

By implementing data reliability safeguards and strengthening rural survey outreach, the Department can improve equity in resource distribution and ensure that aid reaches the communities who need it most.

## 6.3 Specific Recommendations

**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.

```{r recommendations-data}
# Create a summary table using your county reliability data
# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category

# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():
# - High Confidence: "Safe for algorithmic decisions"
# - Moderate Confidence: "Use with caution - monitor outcomes"  
# - Low Confidence: "Requires manual review or additional data"
decision_framework <- ms_reliability %>%
  select(county_name, median_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability) %>%
  mutate(
    # Add algorithm decision recommendations
    algorithm_recommendation = case_when(
      reliability == "High Confidence" ~ "Safe for algorithmic decisions",
      reliability == "Moderate Confidence" ~ "Use with caution - monitor outcomes",
      reliability == "Low Confidence" ~ "Requires manual review or additional data",
      TRUE ~ "Not Classified"
    )
  )
# Format as a professional table with kable()
kable(
  decision_framework,
  caption = "Algorithm Decision Framework for County-Level Data",
  col.names = c("County", "Median Income", "MOE %", "Reliability", "Algorithm Recommendation"),
  format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
)
```

**Key Recommendations:**

**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.

1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]

These counties have high-confidence data with low margins of error (MOE), meaning the information is statistically reliable and accurate.
- The population is well-represented in surveys.
- Data is consistent and stable over time.
- Minimal risk of algorithmic bias caused by data errors.

Counties:
DeSoto, Harrison, Jackson, Lowndes, Madison, Rankin, Warren

2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]
These counties have moderate-confidence data, indicating some risk of errors or gaps. While the data is generally usable, there are enough limitations that algorithmic decisions must be closely supervised.

Monitoring actions needed:

- Human review of algorithm outputs to catch anomalies or unfair patterns.
- Regular audits of decisions, especially in high-impact areas such as resource allocation or eligibility for aid programs.
- Continuous data tracking, updating the system as new survey data becomes available.
- Community feedback loops to validate results and identify potential issues early.

Counties:
Alcorn, Benton, Bolivar, Calhoun, Chickasaw, Clay, Coahoma, Copiah, Forrest, George, Hancock, Hinds, Holmes, Jones, Kemper, Lafayette, Lamar, Lauderdale, Lawrence, Leake, Lee, Leflore, Lincoln, Marion, Monroe, Newton, Pearl River, Pike, Pontotoc, Simpson, Tate, Tippah, Union

3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]
These counties have low-confidence data, often due to very high margins of error or incomplete reporting.

- Data may be missing or misrepresent entire communities.
- There is a high risk of algorithmic bias if decisions rely solely on this data.
- Automated decisions could lead to misallocation of resources or inequitable outcomes.

Recommended alternative approaches:

- Manual review of decisions by local experts to account for nuances not captured by the data.
- Supplementary data collection, such as targeted community surveys or administrative records.
- Blended approaches, combining algorithmic analysis with on-the-ground insights from social workers, local agencies, or nonprofits.
- Pilot programs to test algorithms on a small scale before wider rollout.

Counties:
Adams, Amite, Attala, Carroll, Choctaw, Claiborne, Clarke, Covington, Franklin, Greene, Grenada, Humphreys, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jasper, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Marshall, Montgomery, Neshoba, Noxubee, Oktibbeha, Panola, Perry, Prentiss, Quitman, Scott, Sharkey, Smith, Stone, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, Tishomingo, Tunica, Walthall, Washington, Wayne, Webster, Wilkinson, Winston, Yalobusha, Yazoo

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. Do rural areas or border regions consistently show higher margins of error compared to urban centers like Jackson or Gulfport?
2. What spatial factors (e.g., population density, survey reach, infrastructure) drive these reliability differences?
3. Has the data reliability improved or worsened over time in Mississippi?
4. Are certain counties consistently underrepresented in ACS data year after year, indicating a systemic issue in data collection?

# Technical Notes

**Data Sources:** 
- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates
- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 18 September 2025

**Reproducibility:** 
- All analysis conducted in R version R4.4.1
- Census API key required for replication
- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-itsnatani-humaira.html

**Methodology Notes:**
When selecting counties for analysis, I randomly chose a subset of counties from each reliability category: high confidence, moderate confidence, and low confidence. This random selection helped ensure representation across different reliability levels but was not stratified by population size, demographics, or geography.

**Limitations:**
[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]

- Only a subset of counties was included, meaning findings might not generalize to all Mississippi counties.
- The analysis is limited to Mississippi, so conclusions about patterns and reliability cannot be extended to other states without additional data.
- The 15% MOE threshold used to define low confidence is an analytical choice.Using a different threshold could shift which counties fall into each category, potentially affecting conclusions.
