### **Research Question**

> **How accurately can we predict 2023–2024 residential sale prices in Philadelphia using property characteristics and neighborhood/contextual features, in order to improve the city's automated property tax assessment model?**

---

### **Why This Matters**

- **Fairer property tax assessments** across neighborhoods  
- **Reduced appeals and administrative costs** for the city  
- **Greater public trust** through transparent, data-driven valuations

(Henry, please polish this to suit the research question better)

## **Data Overview**

### **Our Data Foundation**

- **Philadelphia Property Sales (2023–2024)**  
  Over **17,000 residential transactions** citywide capturing sale price, location, and property details.

- **Neighborhood & Contextual Data**  
  Combined city (OpenDataPhilly) and census (ACS 2023) information on:
  - **Community factors:** race, employment rate, median rent, education level, neighborhood
  - **Public safety:** proximity to vioelnt crime
  - **Accessibility:** bike routes
  - **Amenities & services:** parks, public schools, fire department, food retail

## **What Do Home Prices Look Like in Philadelphia?**

![Histogram of Sale Prices]{width="75%" align="center"}

**Key Findings**
- Most homes sell for **under \$400,000**  
- A small number of **luxury properties** push up the high end  
- Reflects **strong housing inequality** across neighborhoods  

(Henry, please edit key findings and slides layout for the three visualization slides)

## **Where Are Expensive Homes in Philadelphia?**

**Key Findings**

- **Center City** and **Northwest Philadelphia** command premium prices  
- **River Wards** show **emerging appreciation**  
- **Outer neighborhoods** remain **most affordable**

## How Does Model Performance Improve?

| Model                                     | CV RMSE  | R²   |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|------|
| Structural Only                           | 139,097  | 0.67  |
| Spatial                                   | 111,374  | 0.79  |
| **Fixed Effects**                         |  95,370  | **0.85** |
| **Hyper-model**                           |  65,382  | **0.93** |

**Bottom Line**  
Each additional data layer improves accuracy, with neighborhood / market-value features producing the largest jump (lowest RMSE and highest R²).

---

## **What Drives the Improvement?**

- From taking into accounts only the structural/building quality variables in our first model;
- **Adding Spatial Data** accounts for proximity to parks, public schools, food retail, and violent crime. 
- **Adding Census & Socioeconomic Context** captures income, education, and housing quality  
- **Adding Neighborhood Fixed Effects** controls for unobserved local traits  
- **Grouping Small Neighborhoods** stabilizes estimates where data are sparse (sales<10) 
- **Including Market Value Benchmarks** aligns predictions with broader price trends  

**Takeaway:**  
Philadelphia’s housing market is highly localized — accuracy improves most when models reflect neighborhood structure and market context.
The Hyper model which optimized by groups small neighborhoods, is more parsimonious while maintaining high predictive performance.

## **Best Models**

| Model                                      | RMSE (\$) | R² |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------|----|
| **Model 3: Fixed Effects**                 | **\$95,370** | **0.85** |
| **Model 4: Hyper Model** | **\$65,382** | **0.93** |

Both models capture **structural**, **spatial**, **census**, and **socioeconomic** factors,  
while incorporating **neighborhood effects** to reflect local market variation.

**Key Insight:**  
Adding small-neighborhood grouping and market value signals delivers a major leap in accuracy — boosting R² from 0.85 → 0.93. By going down to the block level, our model captures fine-grained local variation, showing that neighborhood and market context are essential for fair property assessments.

## **Key Findings**

**Model Accuracy** RMSE = \$65,382 & R² = 0.93 

**Top Predictors**
- Neighborhoods (Prestige/unobserved characteristics)
- Market Value

## **Policy Recommendations**

**Key Actions**
- ✓ Current AVM **undervalues transit-accessible properties**  
- ✓ Model **struggles in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods**  
- ✓ Incorporate **updated neighborhood effects** to improve fairness  
- ✓ Use **regular data refreshes** to maintain accuracy over time
