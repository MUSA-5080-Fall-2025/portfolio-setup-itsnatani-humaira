Overview\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n- Apply spatial operations to answer policy-relevant research questions\n- Integrate census demographic data with spatial analysis\n- Create publication-quality visualizations and maps\n- Work with spatial data from multiple sources\n- Communicate findings effectively for policy audiences\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\n### Research Question\n\n**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**\n\nYour analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.\n\n### Required Analysis Steps\n\nComplete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)\n\nLoad the required spatial data:\n- Pennsylvania county boundaries\n- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)\n- Pennsylvania census tracts\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required
