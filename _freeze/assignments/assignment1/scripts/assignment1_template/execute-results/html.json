The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd\n      text: \"Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n# Set your Census API key\ncensus_api_key(\"28da3bddd17210421250559be63d8c9379ee190c\")\n# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state\nstate_choice <- \"MS\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **Mississippi** for this analysis because it is among the poorest and most food-insecure states in the U.S. My goal is to identify communities that should be prioritized for social service funding and outreach programs. By directing resources toward the most vulnerable populations, these programs can more effectively address disparities and help uplift communities in greatest need, ultimately working to reduce the overall gap in well-being across the state.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\nms_data <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\"\n  ),\n  state = \"MS\",\n  year = 2022,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\nms_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 82 × 6\n   GEOID NAME                total_popE total_popM median_incomeE median_incomeM\n   <chr> <chr>                    <dbl>      <dbl>          <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1 28001 Adams County, Miss…      29425         NA          37271           4671\n 2 28003 Alcorn County, Mis…      34717         NA          47716           4160\n 3 28005 Amite County, Miss…      12683         NA          34866           3839\n 4 28007 Attala County, Mis…      17842         NA          42680           5034\n 5 28009 Benton County, Mis…       7637         NA          38750           3034\n 6 28011 Bolivar County, Mi…      30688         NA          37845           3176\n 7 28013 Calhoun County, Mi…      13193         NA          44505           3793\n 8 28015 Carroll County, Mi…       9930         NA          42285          14597\n 9 28017 Chickasaw County, …      17024         NA          40224           3081\n10 28019 Choctaw County, Mi…       8208         NA          41887           4482\n# ℹ 72 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\nms_clean <- ms_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Remove state name from county names\n    county_name = str_remove(NAME, \" County, Mississippi\")\n  )\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(ms_clean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  GEOID NAME     total_popE total_popM median_incomeE median_incomeM county_name\n  <chr> <chr>         <dbl>      <dbl>          <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>      \n1 28001 Adams C…      29425         NA          37271           4671 Adams      \n2 28003 Alcorn …      34717         NA          47716           4160 Alcorn     \n3 28005 Amite C…      12683         NA          34866           3839 Amite      \n4 28007 Attala …      17842         NA          42680           5034 Attala     \n5 28009 Benton …       7637         NA          38750           3034 Benton     \n6 28011 Bolivar…      30688         NA          37845           3176 Bolivar    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  -

This represents 52% of all counties, indicating that a significant portion of the available data may not be reliable for algorithmic decision-making. Relying on such data to inform policies carries a high risk of policy bias, which could result in inaccurate targeting of resources and services.\n\nSome counties with the highest MOE include Carroll, Issaquena, Sharkey, Tunica, and Wilkinson, where income data has MOE values ranging from 23% to 34%. Algorithms dependent on this census income data may therefore misrepresent the actual economic conditions in these areas, potentially leading to communities being underfunded or overlooked.\n\nSeveral factors may contribute to these high levels of uncertainty, such as:\n- Small population sizes, which increase sampling variability.\n- Limited survey response rates.\n- Data collection challenges, including underreporting or outdated information.\n- Economic and demographic fluctuations, which are harder to capture accurately with small sample sizes.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- ms_reliability %>% filter(county_name == \"Carroll\" | county_name == \"Chickasaw\" | county_name == \"DeSoto\")\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselect(selected_counties, county_name, median_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  county_name median_incomeE moe_percentage reliability        \n  <chr>                <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>              \n1 Carroll              42285             35 Low Confidence     \n2 Chickasaw            40224              8 Moderate Confidence\n3 DeSoto               79666              3 High Confidence    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** These three counties represent different levels of data reliability, with a significant gap in their margins of error ranging from 3% to 35%. This poses a challenge for state-level algorithmic decision-making, as counties with lower data reliability may be underrepresented or misrepresented.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

The data quality appears to be randomly distributed, regardless of which racial or ethnic group dominates a particular census tract.\n\nA possible reason why some tracts have low confidence estimates could be due to small population sizes in those tracts. Smaller populations tend to produce higher margins of error in survey-based estimates, because sampling variability is greater when fewer people are surveyed.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nMississippi is one of the hungriest and poorest states in the U.S. To ensure that aid programs are implemented effectively and reach the communities most in need, decisions about which areas receive resources must be based on reliable and accurate data. Unfortunately, our analysis found data quality issues in many parts of Mississippi, creating challenges for equitable program delivery.\n\nOur analysis revealed no clear geographic or demographic pattern to the distribution of low-quality data. Census tracts with high margins of error (MOE) were randomly distributed across the three counties analyzed — Carroll, Chickasaw, and DeSoto — and did not consistently align with the racial or ethnic composition of the population. This suggests that data reliability is not systematically related to whether a tract is majority White, Black, or Hispanic.\n\nBecause low data reliability is randomly distributed, all communities are equally at risk of algorithmic bias if unreliable data is used in decision-making.High MOE tracts, regardless of demographic makeup, could be overlooked or misclassified, resulting in unequal access to resources. This risk is particularly concerning in vulnerable areas with high poverty rates, where unreliable data could hide urgent needs and exacerbate existing inequities.\n\nOur findings suggest several underlying factors driving both data quality issues and algorithmic bias risks:\n1. Small Population Sizes.\tRural tracts have fewer survey respondents, leading to higher sampling variability and larger margins of error.\n2. Survey Coverage Gaps.\tCertain areas may have limited census outreach or lower response rates, especially in hard-to-reach communities.\n\nThese factors combine to make rural and low-population tracts particularly vulnerable to unreliable data, even though our analysis showed no demographic-specific pattern. To ensure aid programs are accurately targeted and equitable, we recommend the Department take the following actions:\n\n1. Integrate Data Reliability Checks\n2. Flag tracts with unreliable data for manual review before decisions are made.\n3. Invest in Rural Data Collection\n4. Strengthen survey outreach efforts in small or hard-to-reach tracts to increase response rates and improve reliability over time.\n\nThe lack of a clear demographic pattern in data reliability suggests that no single community is disproportionately affected by poor data quality. However, the random distribution of unreliable data, especially in rural areas, creates a systemic risk of misallocation and algorithmic bias.\n\nBy implementing data reliability safeguards and strengthening rural survey outreach, the Department can improve equity in resource distribution and ensure that aid reaches the communities who need it most.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

While the data is generally usable, there are enough limitations that algorithmic decisions must be closely supervised.\n\nMonitoring actions needed:\n\n- Human review of algorithm outputs to catch anomalies or unfair patterns.\n- Regular audits of decisions, especially in high-impact areas such as resource allocation or eligibility for aid programs.\n- Continuous data tracking, updating the system as new survey data becomes available.\n- Community feedback loops to validate results and identify potential issues early.\n\nCounties:\nAlcorn, Benton, Bolivar, Calhoun, Chickasaw, Clay, Coahoma, Copiah, Forrest, George, Hancock, Hinds, Holmes, Jones, Kemper, Lafayette, Lamar, Lauderdale, Lawrence, Leake, Lee, Leflore, Lincoln, Marion, Monroe, Newton, Pearl River, Pike, Pontotoc, Simpson, Tate, Tippah, Union\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\nThese counties have low-confidence data, often due to very high margins of error or incomplete reporting.\n\n- Data may be missing or misrepresent entire communities.\n- There is a high risk of algorithmic bias if decisions rely solely on this data.\n- Automated decisions could lead to misallocation of resources or inequitable outcomes.\n\nRecommended alternative approaches:\n\n- Manual review of decisions by local experts to account for nuances not captured by the data.\n- Supplementary data collection, such as targeted community surveys or administrative records.\n- Blended approaches, combining algorithmic analysis with on-the-ground insights from social workers, local agencies, or nonprofits.\n- Pilot programs to test algorithms on a small scale before wider rollout.\n\nCounties:\nAdams, Amite, Attala, Carroll, Choctaw, Claiborne, Clarke, Covington, Franklin, Greene, Grenada, Humphreys, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jasper, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Marshall, Montgomery, Neshoba, Noxubee, Oktibbeha, Panola, Perry, Prentiss, Quitman, Scott, Sharkey, Smith, Stone, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, Tishomingo, Tunica, Walthall, Washington, Wayne, Webster, Wilkinson, Winston, Yalobusha, Yazoo\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. Do rural areas or border regions consistently show higher margins of error compared to urban centers like Jackson or Gulfport?\n2. What spatial factors (e.g., population density, survey reach, infrastructure) drive these reliability differences?\n3. Has the data reliability improved or worsened over time in Mississippi?\n4. Are certain counties consistently underrepresented in ACS data year after year, indicating a systemic issue in data collection?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 18 September 2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version R4.4.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-itsnatani-humaira.html\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nWhen selecting counties for analysis, I randomly chose a subset of counties from each reliability category: high confidence, moderate confidence, and low confidence. This random selection helped ensure representation across different reliability levels but was not stratified by population size, demographics, or geography.\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size issues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.]\n\n- Only a subset of counties was included, meaning findings might not generalize to all Mississippi counties.\n- The analysis is limited to Mississippi, so conclusions about patterns and reliability cannot be extended to other states without additional data.\n- The 15% MOE threshold used to define low confidence is an analytical choice.Using a different threshold could shift which counties fall into each category, potentially affecting conclusions.\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
